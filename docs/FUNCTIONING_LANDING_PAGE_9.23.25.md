## üí° Notes for Next Session

1. Calendar component needs to:
   - Query TableInventory for selected table type
   - Disable dates that are fully booked
   - Show different prices for weekdays/weekends
2. Consider using a calendar library:
   - `react-day-picker`
   - `react-calendar`
   - Or build custom with date-fns

3. State management consideration:
   - May need Zustand or Context API for booking flow
   - Track: selected table, date, bottles, customer info

## üéØ MVP Definition

Minimum needed for demo:

1. ‚úÖ View tables
2. ‚úÖ See table details
3. ‚è≥ Select date
4. ‚è≥ Choose bottles
5. ‚è≥ Enter customer info
