# Session Development Summary - [Date]

## Overview

Completed core MVP functionality including redirect fixes, email confirmations, and authenticated admin dashboard. System is now production-ready pending payment integration.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Confirmation Page Redirect Issue

**Problem:** After successful booking, users were redirected away from confirmation page back to calendar due to race condition between store clearing and redirect guards.

**Solution:** Implemented three-layer protection system:

- **Layer 1:** sessionStorage flag set during booking completion, expires after 5 seconds
- **Layer 2:** Pathname checks ensuring guards only run on correct pages
- **Layer 3:** hasCheckedRedirect ref preventing multiple executions

**Impact:** Confirmation page now loads reliably, users see booking details without interruption.

### 2. Email Confirmation System

**Technology:** Resend (3,000 free emails/month)

**Features:**

- Professional HTML template with full booking details
- Includes confirmation code, table info, bottles, pricing breakdown
- Special requests and occasion displayed
- Link to view booking online
- Automatic sending on booking creation
- Non-blocking (won't break booking if email fails)

**Current Status:** Using test sender (onboarding@resend.dev), needs domain verification for production.

### 3. Admin Dashboard

**Capabilities:**

- Overview stats (total bookings, by status, revenue)
- Search functionality (code, name, email, phone)
- Filters (status, date)
- Booking table with sortable columns
- Inline status updates
- Detailed booking view modal
- Revenue tracking (confirmed/completed only)

**Status Management:**

- PENDING: Initial state
- CONFIRMED: Admin verified
- COMPLETED: Event finished
- CANCELLED: Customer cancelled
- NO_SHOW: Customer didn't arrive

### 4. Authentication System

**Technology:** NextAuth.js with credentials provider

**Security:**

- Session-based JWT authentication
- 24-hour session expiry
- Middleware protection on /admin routes
- Environment variable credentials (MVP approach)
- Login page at /admin/login

**Production Considerations:**

- Currently uses simple username/password
- Should migrate to database-backed auth for scaling
- Consider adding rate limiting
- Add audit logging for admin actions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Redirect Guard Pattern

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (hasCheckedRedirect.current) return
  hasCheckedRedirect.current = true

  if (pathname !== expectedPath) return

  const recentBooking = sessionStorage.getItem('booking_just_completed')
  if (recentBooking && parseInt(recentBooking) > Date.now() - 5000) return

  if (!requiredData) {
    router.push(fallbackRoute)
  }
}, [pathname, requiredData, router])
```
